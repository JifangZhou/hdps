====

High dimensional propensity score algorithm

Install
-------
This package can be installed using the `devtools` package in R:
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("lendle/hdps")
# or if that doesn't work, try
install_git("git@github.com:lendle/hdps")
```

Documentation
-------------

Wouldn't it be great if you could automatically generate markdown files from `.Rd` files so you could just view the docs directly on github? Well you can't. So open up R and do this instead:
```r
library(hdps)
?hdps
```
